# Fight-Game
First video game I've made and it uses JavaFX.
MAJOR problems with balance. It was for a class with a close dead line so I had no time to refine the balance between classes and enemies. I have not and most likely will not return to fix this as I have moved forward with other more interesting projects and this was just meant to be a introduction to programming games. 
MINOR problems with AI movement. Some random cases when they get stuck and try to work their way out, the AI will break the barriors of the game.
